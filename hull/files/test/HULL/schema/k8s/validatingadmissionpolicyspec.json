Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.\n  For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.\n- 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.\n  See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz\n- 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the\n  request resource.\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object.
