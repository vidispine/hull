      "description": "Expression represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec CEL expressions have access to the contents of the Admission request/response, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:\n\n'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. 'request' - Attributes of the admission request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:\n\t  \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",\n\t  \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\".\nExamples:\n  - Expression accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"Expression\": \"object.__namespace__ > 0\"}\n  - Expression accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"Expression\": \"object.x__dash__prop > 0\"}\n  - Expression accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"Expression\": \"object.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}\n\nEquality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:\n  - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and\n    non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.\n  - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values\n    are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with\n    non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.\nRequired.",
