This input to this expression would have the following fields:\n\n    device.driver\n    device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"].model\n    device.attributes[\"ext.example.com\"].family\n    device.capacity[\"dra.example.com\"].modules\n\nThe device.driver field can be used to check for a specific driver, either as a high-level precondition (i.e. you only want to consider devices from this driver) or as part of a multi-clause expression that is meant to consider devices from different drivers.\n\nThe value type of each attribute is defined by the device definition, and users who write these expressions must consult the documentation for their specific drivers. The value type of each capacity is Quantity.\n\nIf an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned. Any reference to an unknown field will cause an evaluation error and allocation to abort.\n\nA robust expression should check for the existence of attributes before referencing them.\n\nFor ease of use, the cel.bind() function is enabled, and can be used to simplify expressions that access multiple attributes with the same domain. For example:\n\n    cel.bind(dra, device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"], dra.someBool && dra.anotherBool)\n\nThe length of the expression must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki.

This input to this expression would have the following fields:\n\n    device.driver\n    device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"].model\n    device.attributes[\"ext.example.com\"].family\n    device.capacity[\"dra.example.com\"].modules\n\nThe device.driver field can be used to check for a specific driver, either as a high-level precondition (i.e. you only want to consider devices from this driver) or as part of a multi-clause expression that is meant to consider devices from different drivers.\n\nThe value type of each attribute is defined by the device definition, and users who write these expressions must consult the documentation for their specific drivers. The value type of each capacity is Quantity.\n\nIf an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned. Any reference to an unknown field will cause an evaluation error and allocation to abort.\n\nA robust expression should check for the existence of attributes before referencing them.\n\nFor ease of use, the cel.bind() function is enabled, and can be used to simplify expressions that access multiple attributes with the same domain. For example:\n\n    cel.bind(dra, device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"], dra.someBool && dra.anotherBool)\n\nThe length of the expression must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki. The cost of evaluating it is also limited based on the estimated number of logical steps.",
